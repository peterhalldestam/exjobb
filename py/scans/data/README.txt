                    Input params:
                        - Injected nD in [10^18, 2x10^22] (m^-3)
                        - Injected nNe in [10^16, 10^20] (m^-3)
                    Rerun with more points and make final plot for report, and
                    make sure to use correct objective function (baseObjective)
